## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
Conduct surveys or user interviews.
Use analytics to track engagement and drop-off points.
Check feedback from support tickets or forums.
Start with common concepts and gauge responses before diving deeper.
## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
Use everyday language and analogies.
